 * Land areas and the coastline.

 * This layer is where Fase 2 is won or lost. It declares two different things about the same
 * geometry and lets `reduce` decide how each is drawn:
 *
 * - the **area**, so the shore cell gets a quadrant or a directional edge glyph by coverage;
 * - the **outline** as a COAST line, so wherever the shore is thinner than a cell it comes out
 *   as braille, at 2x4 sub-cell precision.
 *
 * That second declaration is why the coast reads as a continuous stroke instead of a staircase.
