 * index — it projects every coordinate to discover it is off screen. The geometry cache already
 * makes a still camera free, so this is only paid while actively dragging.
 *
 * Two fixes have been measured on a 240x70 grid at L4 with land-10m:
 *   - Spherical-cap culling per polygon and per outline segment: 87 ms -> 39 ms, applied.
 *   - Visvalingam simplification per LOD, which docs/DATA.md step 3 calls for: rejected. At a
 *     half-cell tolerance it removed only 20-36 % of points while tripling the files, because
 *     simplification discards the topology's integer quantization.
 *
 * The 39 ms that remain are one continent's worth of coordinates: a bounding cap around South
 * America overlaps any nearby view, so culling cannot reject it, and subdividing it further is
 * precisely what tiling means. That is Fase 6 (docs/DATA.md, nivel urbano), not a threshold to
 * tune here. L0-L3 are inside budget; L4 is playable but not.
