 * screen, and ruinous close in, where nearly nothing is. Measured on a 240x70 grid at 20 km
 * altitude, before any of this existed: hydro 72 ms and landmask 39 ms, against a 10 ms budget
 * for the entire frame.
 *
 * A cap — a centre and an angular radius — is the cheapest conservative bound on the sphere.
 * Everything here is arithmetic on precomputed unit vectors: `geoDistance` is a haversine, and
