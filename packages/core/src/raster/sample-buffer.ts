/**
 * The sample buffer: where geometry layers declare what is where, at braille subcell
 * resolution, before any character has been chosen. docs/RENDERING.md, paso 1.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the doc, both forced by CLAUDE.md's "core no toca el DOM":
 *
 * 1. **No offscreen canvas.** The doc describes painting to a canvas and reading it back with
 *    one `getImageData`. Canvas is unavailable in Node and React Native, which would take the
 *    plain-text visual snapshot suite — the project's stated safety net — with it. So geometry
 *    is rasterized here in plain typed arrays instead. The pipeline stages are unchanged.
 * 2. **Planar channels, not interleaved RGBA.** RGBA packing existed to match `getImageData`.
 *    With no canvas in the path the channels are separate arrays; the *semantics* of the four
 *    channels are exactly as documented.
 *
 * There is also one addition: `bodyMask`, the body silhouette. Without it a cell of open ocean
 * and a cell of empty space are indistinguishable (both have zero coverage). The silhouette is
 * not layer data — it follows from the projection — so the pipeline fills it, not a layer.
